<h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
    <p> Code republic is a simple website where you can read a little about some programming languages such java,python and C programming language.
        A computer is not smart. Believe it or not, on your worst days, you are still light-years ahead of your
            computer in intelligence. You can think, and you can tell a computer what to do. Here is where the
            computer shines: It will obey your instructions. Your computer will sit for days processing the data
            you supply, without getting bored or wanting overtime pay.<br>
            The computer can't decide what to do on its own. Computers can't think for themselves, so
            programmers (people who tell computers what to do) must give computers extremely detailed
            instructions. Without instructions, a computer is useless; with incorrect instructions, a computer will
            not successfully execute your desired task.<br> 
            The collection of detailed expressions that you supply when you want your computer to perform a
            specific task is known as a computer program.</p>

                    <h1>-PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES</h1>
                <p>A computer programming language is  any of various languages for expressing a set of detailed instructions for a digital computer. <br> Such instructions can be executed directly when they are in the computer manufacturer-specific numerical form known as machine language, after a simple substitution process when expressed in a corresponding assembly language, or after translation from some “higher-level” language.<br>  Although there are many computer languages, relatively few are widely used.
                        Machine and assembly languages are “low-level,” requiring a programmer to manage explicitly all of a computer’s idiosyncratic features of data storage and operation. In contrast, high-level languages shield a programmer from worrying about such considerations and provide a notation that is more easily written and read by programmers.
                        Language Types:<br>
                        Machine and assembly languages<br>
                        A machine language consists of the numeric codes for the operations that a particular computer can execute directly.<br> The codes are strings of 0s and 1s, or binary digits (“bits”), which are frequently converted both from and to hexadecimal (base 16) for human viewing and modification.<br> Machine language instructions typically use some bits to represent operations, such as addition, and some to represent operands, or perhaps the location of the next instruction. <br>Machine language is difficult to read and write, since it does not resemble conventional mathematical notation or human language, and its codes vary from computer to computer.
                        Assembly language is one level above machine language. It uses short mnemonic codes for instructions and allows the programmer to introduce names for blocks of memory that hold data.<br> One might thus write “add pay, total” instead of “0110101100101000” for an instruction that adds two numbers.<br>
                        Assembly language is designed to be easily translated into machine language. Although blocks of data may be referred to by name instead of by their machine addresses, assembly language does not provide more sophisticated means of organizing complex information. Like machine language, assembly language requires detailed knowledge of internal computer architecture. It is useful when such details are important, as in programming a computer to interact with input/output devices (printers, scanners, storage devices, and so forth).
                        Algorithmic languages:<br>
                        Algorithmic languages are designed to express mathematical or symbolic computations. They can express algebraic operations in notation similar to mathematics and allow the use of subprograms that package commonly used operations for reuse. They were the first high-level languages.<br>
                       
                        

                        <div class="content">
                                <h1>-JAVA</h1>
                        •	Java is a general-purpose programming language that is class-based, object-oriented, and designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA),meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.<br>Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. <br>As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use according to GitHub,particularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.<br>
                        •	Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which has since been acquired by Oracle) and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. The original and reference implementation Java compilers, virtual machines, and class libraries were originally released by Sun under proprietary licenses. As of May 2007, in compliance with the specifications of the Java Community Process, Sun had relicensed most of its Java technologies under the GNU General Public License. Meanwhile, others have developed alternative implementations of these Sun technologies, such as the GNU Compiler for Java (bytecode compiler), GNU Classpath (standard libraries), and IcedTea-Web (browser plugin for applets).<br>
                        •	The latest versions are Java 13, released in September 2019, and Java 11, a currently supported long-term support (LTS) version, released on September 25, 2018; Oracle released for the legacy Java 8 LTS the last free public update in January 2019 for commercial use, while it will otherwise still support Java 8 with public updates for personal use up to at least December 2020. Oracle (and others) highly recommend uninstalling older versions of Java because of serious risks due to unresolved security issues.[20] Since Java 9 (and 10 and 12) is no longer supported, Oracle advises its users to immediately transition to the latest version (currently Java 13) or an LTS release<br>

                                <h1>-C</h1>
                        The C programming language was developed in 1972 by Dennis Ritchie and Brian Kernighan at the AT&T Corporation for programming computer operating systems. Its capacity to structure data and programs through the composition of smaller units is comparable to that of ALGOL.<br> It uses a compact notation and provides the programmer with the ability to operate with the addresses of data as well as with their values. This ability is important in systems programming, and C shares with assembly language the power to exploit all the features of a computer’s internal architecture. C, along with its descendant C++, remains one of the most common languages.
                        Business-oriented languages.<br>  
                        
                        <div class="content">
                                <h1>-PYTHON</h1>
                        Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.[27]
                        Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. Python is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.<br>
                        Python was conceived in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC language. Python 2.0, released in 2000, introduced features like list comprehensions and a garbage collection system capable of collecting reference cycles. Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible, and much Python 2 code does not run unmodified on Python 3.
                        The Python 2 language, i.e. Python 2.7.x, is "sunsetting" on January 1, 2020 (after extension; first planned for 2015), and the Python team of volunteers will not fix security issues, or improve it in other ways after that date.With the end-of-life, only Python 3.5.x and later will be supported.
                        Python interpreters are available for many operating systems. A global community of programmers develops and maintains CPython, an open source reference implementation. A non-profit organization, the Python Software Foundation, manages and directs resources for Python and CPython development.<br>
